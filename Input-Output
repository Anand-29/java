Input & Output

 Hello World

This is the very first program in the programming language, you have to include an only single header file that is import java.util.Scanner;, this header file contains the declaration of System.out.println()function. System.out.println() is used to display the message as well as the value on the standard output device (monitor), use of printf function is very easy, you have to just pass the string (message) that you want to print on the screen within inverted commas ("message").

Sample Output:

Hello World

Input (stdin)

Output (stdout)

Hello World


Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

             public static void main(String args[])

             {

             System.out.println("Hello World");

             }

}

Hello World with tab

There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in the programming language,

you have to use \t escape sequence in order to provide 4 to 5 spaces between words in the output console.

Enter the escape sequence directly into the System.out. println() statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\tsage").

Sample Output:

Hello World Hello World

Input (stdin)


Output (stdout)

Hello World        Hello World

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

        System.out.println("Hello World\tHello World");

    }

}

Hello World with new line

There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in the programming language,

you have to use \n escape sequence in order to provide a new line between words in the output console.

Enter the escape sequence directly into the System.out.println() statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\nsage").


Sample Output:

Hello World

Hello World

Input (stdin)


Output (stdout)

Hello WorldHello World 

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

        System.out.println("Hello World\nHello World");

    }

}

Character Input

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are System.out.println() and System.in(). Write a program to get a character as input and print it. The Scanner class reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in the variable test character.

Sample Input:

z

Sample Output:

z

Input (stdin)

a


Output (stdout)

a

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

      char a = s.next().charAt(0);

      System.out.print(a);

    }

}

Integer Input

Java programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are System.out.println() and System.in(). Write a program to get an integer as input and print it. The System.in() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters an integer, it is stored in variable testInteger. Format string %d is used in case of integer types. Note the '&' sign before testInteger; &testInteger gets the address of testInteger and the value is stored in that address.


Sample Input:

56

 

Sample Output:

56

Input (stdin)

0


Output (stdout)

0

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

      int a = s.nextInt();

      System.out.print(a);

    }

}

Float Input

Write a program to get float as input and print it. The Scanner class reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters the float value, it is stored in variable testFloat. Use '%.2f' in the System.out.printf() to display float value with 2 precisions.

Sample Input - 1:

56.2425

 

Sample Output - 1:

56.24

 

Sample Input - 2:

92.00

 

Sample Output - 2:

92.00

Input (stdin)

14


Output (stdout)

14.00

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

      Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

      Float a = s.nextFloat();

      System.out.printf("%.2f",a);

    }

}

String Input

Write a program to get the string as input and print it. When the user enters a string (i.e) char array, it is stored in variable testString.


Sample Input - 1:

Programmer

 

Sample Output - 1:

Programmer

 

Sample Input - 2:

897

 

Sample Output - 2:

897

Input (stdin)

face


Output (stdout)

face

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

      Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

      String a = s.next();

      System.out.print(a);        

    }

}

Unicode Values-I

Write a program to get a character as input and print its Unicode value. When a character is entered, the character itself is not stored. Instead, a numeric value(Unicode value) is stored.


Sample Input :

g

Sample Output:

103

Input (stdin)

G


Output (stdout)

71

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

      Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

      char a = s.next().charAt(0);

      System.out.print((int)a);

    }

}

Unicode Values-II

Write a program to get a number(Unicode values) as input and print its equivalent character. You can display a character if you know ASCII code of that character.


Sample Input:

103

Sample Output:

g

Input (stdin)

71


Output (stdout)

G

 

Program :-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main

{

    public static void main(String args[])

    {

       Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

       int a = s.nextInt();

      System.out.print((char)a);

    }

}
